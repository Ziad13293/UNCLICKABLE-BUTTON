Kill THAT DISGUSTING FLY!!

Bug Squasher Game is a fun, interactive web game where players click on animated bugs to squash them before time runs out. Featuring multiple bug types with different speeds and health points (like quick 1-hit flies and tough 3-hit beetles), the game tracks your score and displays health bars for each bug. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases dynamic DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic, all wrapped in a playful bug-themed interface with humorous feedback messages. Perfect for practicing core web development skills while creating an entertaining experience! This whole thing started with me just trying to make a button that runs away when you click it (lol). Spoiler, It broke. A LOT. But with some patient help, I figured out why my code kept glitching, turns out, semicolons and spelling matter way more than I thought! Slowly, that janky button turned into a game where you whack bugs, with tougher ones needing extra hits. Still messy, but it works! Learned that coding’s basically just fixing one error at a time until stuff magically works. I used DeepSeek, and it can keep up with my insane errors and stupid questions somehow, and for some reason, makes hard things seem insanely easy to code. 

This project started as a simple Unclickable Button joke—a frustrating UI gag where a button dodged clicks while hurling insults. But after playtesting, I realized, why not turn this into a full game? The original button evolved into swarming bugs, the snarky messages became score feedback, and the core mechanic expanded with health bars, multiple enemies, and a timer. The biggest challenges? Making bugs move naturally (without overlapping) and balancing difficulty—those tanky beetles were added specifically to force players to strategize. Next up: sound effects and high score tracking!
